#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by who the user is, what they want, and what they can do with it. Creating user stories following that basic guideline helps compress the user's desires into something readable and small enough to fit on an extensive backlog.
#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs as a step by step process: What needs to be done? What do I need to do to make sure it gets done? What needs to be added to the program to meet those needs? How can I do it efficiently? 
I hope to incorporate Kanban boards and backlogs into my future development work to keep me on track and motivated to finish the project.
#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means being trustworthy, helpful, and open, as well as having good communication skills and the willingness to adjust my goals to help those around me. Using my knowledge to help strengthen the team as a whole is the best way to be a good team member in software development.
